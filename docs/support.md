In the world of open-source hobbyist software, WeeWX is pretty easy
to install and configure. There are not many package dependencies,
the configuration is simple, and it has an extensive [User's Guide](usersguide.md).
There are thousands of people who have successfully done an
install. However, there is no "point-and-click" interface, so
you have to be prepared to roll up your sleeves and get in
there.

You should have the following skills:

- The patience to read and follow the <a href="../docs/usersguide.htm">User's Guide</a>;
- Willingness and ability to edit a configuration file;
- Some familiarity with Linux or other Unix derivatives;
- Know how to do simple Unix tasks like changing file
  permissions and running commands;
- No programming experience is necessary unless you wish
  to extend WeeWX. In this case, you should have some
  familiarity with Python.

If you get stuck, there is a very active User's Group to
help, but please first try to solve the problem yourself.
