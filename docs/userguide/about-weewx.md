## About WeeWX

[WeeWX](http://www.weewx.com) is software, written in [Python](https://www.pythong.org), that interacts with a weather station to produce plots, reports, and HTML pages. It can optionally upload the reports to a remote Web server as well as publish to weather services such as [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/), [CWOP](http://wxqa.com/), or [PWSweather.com](https://www.pwsweather.com/).

Initial development began in the winter of 2008-2009, with the first release in 2009.

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/weewx/weewx), while downloads are available at [weewx.com/downloads](http://weewx.com/downloads).

WeeWX is about 15,000 lines of code, plus another 15,000 for the drivers for all the types of supported hardware.
