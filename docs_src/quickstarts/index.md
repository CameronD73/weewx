# How to install WeeWX

Install WeeWX releases from repositories for Debian, Red Hat, and SuSE systems
using `apt`, `yum/dnf`, or `zypper`, from pypi using `pip`, or run WeeWX
directly from source.

The installers for Debian, Red Hat, and SUSE use the conventions and software
management tools for their respective operating system; these are the quickest
way to get up and running.

* [Debian](debian) - Ubuntu, Mint, Raspian, Devuan
* [Redhat](redhat) - Fedora, CentOS, Rocky
* [SUSE](suse) - openSUSE

The pypi installer will work on any operating system; use this approach for
macOS or one of the *BSDs, or if you are using an older operating system.
This is also a good approach if you plan to do a lot of customization, or if
you are developing a driver, skin, or other extension.

* [pip](pip) - any operating system

If you are working on the WeeWX core, or if you want to experiment with
code that is under development, then you will probably want to run directly
from the source code.
