# How to install WeeWX

There are a few ways to install WeeWX.  Choose the method that best fits your
needs.

The installers for Debian, Red Hat, and SUSE use the conventions and software
management tools for their respective operating system; these are the fastest
and easiest way to get up and running.

* [Debian](debian) - Ubuntu, Mint, Raspberry Pi OS, Devuan
* [Redhat](redhat) - Fedora, CentOS, Rocky
* [SUSE](suse) - openSUSE

The pypi installer will work on any operating system; use this approach for
macOS or one of the BSDs, or if you are using an older operating system.
This is also a good approach if you plan to do a lot of customization, or if
you are developing a driver, skin, or other extension.

* [pip](pip) - any operating system

If you want to install WeeWX on a system with very little storage, or if you
want to experiment with code that is under development, then you may
want to run directly from a clone of the git repository.

* [Run from a git repository](git) - any operating system
