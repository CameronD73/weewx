# Skin configuration options {#skin_options}

This section contains the options available in the skin configuration
file, `skin.conf`. The same options apply to the language files
found in the subdirectory `lang`, such as `lang/en.conf` for English.

We recommend to put

-   options that control the behavior of the skin into `skin.conf`; and
-   language dependent labels and texts into the language files.

It is worth noting that UTF-8 is used throughout the skin configuration file,
just as it is throughout the WeeWX configuration file.
