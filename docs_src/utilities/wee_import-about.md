# wee_import

Some WeeWX users will have historical data from another source (e.g., other
weather station software or a manually compiled file) which they wish to
import into WeeWX. Such data can, depending upon the source, be imported
using the `wee_import` utility. This section details the use of the
`wee_import` utility.

The `wee_import` utility supports importing observational data from the
following sources:

* a single Comma Separated Values (CSV) format file
* the historical observations of a Weather Underground personal weather station
* one or more Cumulus monthly log files
* one or more Weather Display monthly log files
* one or more WeatherCat monthly .cat files
