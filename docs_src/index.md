# Introduction

The WeeWX weather system is written in Python and runs on Linux, MacOSX,
Solaris, and *BSD.  It collects data from many different types of weather
stations and sensors, then generates plots, HTML pages, and monthly and
yearly summary reports. It can push plots, pages, and reports to a web
server, and data data to many different online weather services.

See the WeeWX website for [examples](https://weewx.com/showcase.html) of web
sites generated by WeeWX, and a [map](https://weewx.com/stations.html) of
stations using WeeWX.

See the [hardware list](https://weewx.com/hardware.html) for a complete list
of supported stations, and for pictures to help identify your hardware!  The
[hardware comparison](https://weewx.com/hwcmp.html) shows specifications for
many different types of hardware, including some not yet supported by WeeWX.
