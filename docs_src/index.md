# Introduction

The WeeWX weather system is written in Python and runs on Linux, MacOSX,
Solaris, and *BSD.  It collects data from many different types of weather
stations and sensors, then generates plots, HTML pages, and monthly and
yearly summary reports. It can push plots, pages, and reports to a web
server, and data data to many different online weather services.

See the [hardware list](https://weewx.com/hardware.html) for a complete list
of supported stations, and for pictures to help identify your hardware!  The
[hardware comparison](https://weewx.com/hwcmp.html) shows specifications for
many different types of hardware, including some not yet supported by WeeWX.

The WeeWX distribution includes drivers for many types of hardware.  These
are listed in the [hardware guide](../hardware/drivers). If your hardware
is not in the core driver list, you should first install WeeWX, then download
and install the driver for your hardware.

See the [WeeWX Wiki](https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki) for drivers and
other extensions. After you install WeeWX, use the `weectl` utility to
download and install drivers or other extensions listed in the wiki.
