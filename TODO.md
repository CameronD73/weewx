# To do


## Documentation

Update `DEV_NOTES.txt` with instructions on making documents.


## Drivers

Something funny about function `set_retransmit()` in `vantage.py`.
Did it ever work??

## Utilities

Remove wunderfixer and its documentation.

## Logging

Consider making `$HOME/weewx-data/logs` the default log for MacOS.

Update the logging wiki.


## Documentation

Fill out "Preparation" section in pip.md for RedHat, SuSE, and macOS.

Put legacy (V4.x) docs at weewx.com/legacy_docs.



## Testing


## Upgrade guide

How to switch from init.d to systemd.


## Miscellaneous

Should change the station registry uploader to use `~` instead of the absolute path to the user's
home directory. See Slack: https://weewx.slack.com/archives/C04AEC3K4G7/p1673192099682549
