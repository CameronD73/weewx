# To do

## For the poetry implementation

Applications need to be converted into poetry scripts.

## Configuration related

Change default directory to `~/weewx-data`.

Check for validity of station_url.


## Obsolete

Make sure distutil isn't used anywhere. E.g., `distutils.copytree()`.

## Commands
```
weectl station create
weectl station reconfigure
weectl station upgrade
weectl station upgrade-skins
weectl daemon install
weectl daemon uninstall
weectl extension install
weectl extension uninstall
weectl extension list
```
